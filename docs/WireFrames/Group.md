### Group Page Wire Frames:

Notes:

The first page presented on the screen, after choosing the "Group" icon, is the Group Membership Page (first wire frame below). From said page the user can either click on one of the icons from the Administrator section, where the Group Administrator Window (last wire frame) will pop up, or one of the icons from the member section. Clicking an icon from the member section will take the user to a new page that showcases that particular group's profile (second wire frame).
